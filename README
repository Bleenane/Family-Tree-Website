all these files were constructed using this AI. With a bit of prompting we could possibly get
a better result.

I'm thinking if we use chatGPT to create a prompt to use in the AI linked above we might be able
to receive a better result.

it is also worth using ChatGPT 4 to see what it can come up with on the design of the family Tree

I havent run these files and havent use React and havent coded using HTML since I was 12
so might need Martin to walk through theses and how you can impelment them together.


ive attached a little sketch on a possible idea of the website would love to hear you ideas on it, any clarification 
text into the iMessage group chat.
